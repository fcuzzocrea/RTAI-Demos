Quick adaption of another RTDM test to RTAI (with a small fix).

To use it:
- make
- ./run 0  // something like RTAI latency in user space
- ./run 1  // something like RTAI latency in kern space
- ./run 2  // something like RTAI tasklets timers in kern space
- Ctrl-C to end anything

To know more about execution options:
- ./run
then edit the "run" script accordingly; 
alternatively execute it your own way.
