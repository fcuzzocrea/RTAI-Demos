Basic tests for the HAL, irqs, srqs, timers and ipis.
Useful for checking basic things with new kernels and patches.
Check UP/SMP setting of interrupts relayed by RTAI to linux in lnxshintr.c.
Evaluate interrupt latencies using reschedule ipis (it may not be the
best way, but it shows that a significant part of the task level latency
does depends on the hardware)
BEWARE: interrupts to be intercepted in lnxshintr.c mus be chosen and set
appropriately, according to each specific machine you run on.
