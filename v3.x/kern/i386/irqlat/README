This is example shows raw irq latencies due just to your hardware.
If they are too high there is nothing RTAI can do for you.
The only culprit might be ADEOS, i.e. the only piece of Linux touching
interrupts the hard way, but I strongly doubt that there could be
still any kind of bug like this nowadays.
