This is example shows raw irq latencies due just to your hardware.
In fact there is nothing of RTAI in it. Even if you have to load rtai_hal
the checked interrupt, 8254 timer, is handled directly at the descriptor
table level only.
So if they are too high there is nothing RTAI can do for you.
The only culprit might be ADEOS, i.e. the only piece of Linux touching
interrupts the hard way, but I strongly doubt that there could be
still any kind of bug like this nowadays.
