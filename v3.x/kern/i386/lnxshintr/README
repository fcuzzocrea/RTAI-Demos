****** SHARED LEVEL INTERRUPTS ******

This example shows how interrupts could be shared between real and non real 
time applications.

It must be noted that such a sharing should be avoided as far as possible.
In fact the related (A)PIC interrupts cannot be enabled till all of the shared
interrupts are processed and so it might end with the real time ones having
to wait Linux.

That said it is here, at least is yet another good test for the core RTAI stuff.

You should set the internal array irq with the interrupt numbers to share and 
level to 1-0 according to the related interrupt in irq being level or not.
Yoo can then watch consistency of the related interrupt counts by using "dmesg"
and "cat /proc/interrupts".

To run the example type:

make clean
make
./run

To stop it type enter.
